# MachineTranslationUsingTransformers

The file contains Machine Translation using the Transformers model for kurdish Langauge. According to new studies, Transformers are much faster and more accurate than Seq2Seq model.
the code of this model written using the code of bharadwaj1098 from his github account. it is important the code has been modified slightly to fit kurdish language stranslation.
Moreover, the Datasets acquired from sinaahmedi github account which can be found via this (link)[https://github.com/sinaahmadi/awesome-kurdish]. the corpora were collected and were converted to a pandas data frame.
Luckily, the Bleu score achieved for this model is 0.45 which is considered to be above the state of art.
